Find compound words
===================

Write a program that reads a file containing a sorted list of words (one word per line, no spaces, all lower case), then identifies the longest word in the file that can be constructed by concatenating copies of shorter words also found in the file. The program should then go on to report the second longest word found as well as how many of the words in the list can be constructed of other words in the list.
